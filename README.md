![Alt text](<Gun violence report_page-0001.jpg>)

The aim of this project is to analyze the prevalence of gun violence in the USA over the past years and to build a neural network that would indicate possible hotspots (city/county) where gun violence could occur. After performing a couple of preprocessing the original datasets, visualizations using various features from the data enabled the extraction of the core features that would be used in the neural network model.

### Visuals from the dataset:
